# ======== NOTES ========
# Arcade core will work on most systems using Update_All

# For Console cores make sure you are using the recommended folder structure: /media/fat/Games/SNES/ etc.
# The script supports zipped Everdrive packs or unzipped folders.
# For MegaCD and Turbografx16 CD your games need to be in CHD format.

# /media/usb is not well tested yet
# In particular NTFS formatted drives may casue issues due to NTFS being case-sensitive on MiSTer


# ======== GENERAL OPTIONS ========
# Which systems would you like to display in Attract Mode? 
# Valid options: arcade genesis megacd neogeo nes snes tgfx16 tgfx16cd
corelist="arcade,genesis,megacd,neogeo,nes,snes,tgfx16,tgfx16cd"

# Time before going to the next core
timer=120

# Adjust if you don't use SD card for your file - no trailing slash!
pathfs="/media/fat"


# ======== CONSOLE OPTIONS ========
# If you don't want Attract Mode to use the ZIP files in your game directories for some reason set this to "Yes"
